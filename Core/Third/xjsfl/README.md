# xJSFL

## Intro

**xJSFL is an open source JSFL framework for creating tools and plugins for the Adobe Flash IDE**

![xjsfl-api](https://xjsfl.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/xjsfl-1-01-api.png)

It combines the expressive nature and extensibility of a JavaScript framework like jQuery with
the structure and file management features of PHP frameworks such as Kohana, to make working with JSFL easy.

## Project status

I have not actively worked on xJSFL for many years now, so as of January 2022 I am mothballing the project.

The original **xjsfl.com** website has been moved to static hosting at [xjsfl.vercel.app](https://xjsfl.vercel.app), which means that the search, site comments and forum no longer work, but the documentation **is still accessible**.

I have also made the [xJSFL Komodo Extension](https://github.com/davestewart/xjsfl-komodo-extension) public for the first time. The code is so old now, I suspect it won't run, but maybe someone would want to pick it up.

I think the only other thing to make public would be the original [Snippets](https://xjsfl.vercel.app/feature/snippets-panel) source code, which I can do [on request](issues).

**However, I will not be providing any support or input into the project from now on.**

I hope everyone who enjoyed using it at the time has fond memories!
